<h1><a>&#65517;</a>&nbsp;<b>What is Grid?</b></h1>

<p><big><strong>Grid is a compact and highly configurable party/raid unit frame addon.</strong></big></p>

<p>The compact grid of units lets you select a group member quickly, while keeping a good overview of the whole group. It shows as much information as possible without overloading you. It allows you to customize what information you see, and how you see it. It works in both party and raid groups, and supports pets and vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Want more features?</b> The Grid core tries to include only features which are generally useful for all classes and roles, but makes it easy to add new features with a simple plugin API for developers. <a href="http://www.wowace.com/addons/grid/pages/list-of-grid-plugins/">Over 75 plugins</a> are already available!</p>


<h1><a>&#65517;</a>&nbsp;<b>How to use Grid</b></h1>

<p>To open the options window, type &#8220;<code>/grid</code>&#8221;, right-click the tab on the Grid layout frame, or right-click the Grid icon on your minimap or DataBroker display.</p>

<p>Because Grid is so configurable, its extensive options can be confusing at first. We recommend taking a few minutes to look through the menus and check out all the options before asking for help. There is also a small <a href="http://www.wowace.com/projects/grid/pages/users-guide/">User&#8217;s Guide</a> that may be helpful in explaining some of the terms used in Grid, like <i>status</i>, <i>indicator</i>, and <i>priority</i>.</p>

<h1><a>&#65517;</a>&nbsp;<b>Known Issues</b></h1>

<p>Please don&#8217;t submit new tickets about these issues. We already know about them, and in some cases, they are not actually bugs.</p>

<dl>
	<dt><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoming heals are showing the wrong amount!</b></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Incoming heal amounts come from the game client itself, and Grid has way to tell if they are wrong. Feel free to report any such wrong amounts to Blizzard in the <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1012660/">official WoW Bug Report forum</a>.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoming heals are showing HoT ticks, or not showing at all!</b></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The game client doesn&#8217;t distinguish between direct healing and periodic healing, so Grid has to make assumptions based on the healing amount in order to filter out HoT ticks. By default, healing for less than 10% of the unit&#8217;s total health is hidden.</p>
		<p>You can change this setting by adjusting the &#8220;Minimum value&#8221; setting for the &#8220;Incoming Heals&#8221; status. If you&#8217;ve checked this setting, and still think you should be seeing some heals, it&#8217;s probably Blizzard&#8217;s fault; see FAQ #1 above!</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m using version r1234 and it&#8217;s broken!</b></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Version numbers that follow the &#8220;r1234&#8221; pattern are Alpha versions, or snapshots of the current development process, and are not recommended for general use. <strong>Such versions are not officially supported</strong>, may be unstable, may not work at all, or may even lose your settings.</p>
		<p>If you are not comfortable running experimental code, please stick with the stable Release and Beta versions that are posted on Curse, whose numbers follow the &#8220;4.0.3.1234&#8221; or &#8220;4.0.3.1234-beta&#8221; patterns. These versions are actually tested!</p>
